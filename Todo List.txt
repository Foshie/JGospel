List of things to do:


-	User Interface:
	-	Categories/Filter page on menu bar for users to pick the categories they want.
		The default value is all checked.
		-	Edit Button Looks
		-   Change functionality to act as refresh homepage on button push
		-	Make the spacing between each category bigger
		-	Add a check all checkmark
	-	Hide the ... panel on scroll vertical
		-	Remove Anchor from panel
	-	Track what links have been read using a grayed out text or something.  Opacity filter will work.
	-	Allow user to choose which categories are more important. i.e. closer to the top.
	-	Get Ios implementation to work with custom settings
	-	Extra settings: display how many detailed items in each category at the start.
						display how many to load on each load.
	
	
-	Error checking in AJAX calls that result in a failure causes program to get stuck
